- State (neighbors) -> State
live (< 2) -> dead
live (2, 3) -> live
live (> 3) -> dead
dead (> 3) -> live

- counts all 8 neighbors

- Begin by writing a test case
- Specifies what you want to achieve
- Run, and be sure to watch the test fail!
- Implement functionality
- (Get the tests to pass)
- While implementing, add ideas to the refactor plan
- Refactor code (while keeping the tests passing)

# Test Plan
